# Librecorder
Librecorder is a platform for AI and algorithmic diagnostic analysis at point-of-care in low-resource settings.
The idea is to make a free-libre platform consisting of a small portable computer, a variety of sensors,
and, most of all, a framework for slotting in new software algorithms and AI neural networks which
offer an ever-expanding set of diagnostic functions.

This will create an open-source tool that eventually will be able to diagnose a very large number of 
medical conditions or risk conditions. The idea is to create the "medical tricorder" from the original Star Trek
television series.
